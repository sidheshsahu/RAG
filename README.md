It is an application designed to process and query multiple document types, including PDF, DOCX, PPTX, URLs, CSV, and XLSX. It uses LangChain for document handling, GoogleGenerativeAI for embedding generation, and FAISS for efficient similarity-based searches. With Groqâ€™s Llama-8b-3192 model for question-answering, the app provides accurate responses from document content, while SQLite and ChatGroq enable SQL-like queries on CSV and Excel files. This setup offers a unified solution for flexible document and database interactions across formats.
